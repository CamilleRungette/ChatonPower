# Welcome to the Chaton-Power Website repository!

## Presentation:
This website is a prototype exercise for an online shop selling cat pictures.
Enjoy the cuteness!


## How to use it:
You can either download the repository, run the following command
`bundle install && rails db:create && rails db:migrate && rails db:seed`
and open the project with the rails server plugged in http://localhost:3000/.
But there's an easier way => go to https://chaton-power.herokuapp.com/ for the production version;
                          => or to https://chaton-power-development.herokuapp.com/ for the development version;

## Features:
